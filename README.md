## Feedback Project: React, TypeScript & Vite

**Description:**

This project is a simple feedback system built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. Vite is a powerful tool for blazing-fast development and a great choice for building modern web applications. It allows users to provide feedback on a product or service.

**Features:**

* Form for collecting user feedback
* List of submitted feedback
* Ability to sort feedback by date, rating, or other criteria
* Ability to filter feedback by category or keywords
* Ability for administrators to respond to feedback

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm installed on your system

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/feedback-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd feedback-project
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
npm install
```

**Running the Project:**

1. **For Development:**

```
npm run dev
```

This command will run the project in development mode with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), automatically refreshing the browser whenever you make changes to the code. It will also open your browser at http://localhost:3000.

2. **For Building a Production-Ready Version:**

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production-ready version of your project in the `dist` folder.

**Usage:**

1. After running development mode (`npm run dev`), open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
2. Enter your feedback in the feedback form and click the "Submit" button.
3. Your feedback will be added to the list of submitted feedback.
4. You can sort feedback by date, rating, or other criteria.
5. You can filter feedback by category or keywords.
6. Administrators can respond to feedback.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is just a basic initial prototype and can be extended with additional features and functionality.
* To deploy the project to a production environment, you will need to configure a web server.
* To store user feedback, you will need to set up a database.

I hope this helps you get started with your feedback project using Vite!
# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
